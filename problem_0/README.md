# Problem 0: Factorize a Number

This task is worth 5 points.

In this problem, you need to implement a program that will accept a single integer number and will output a list of prime factors of the given number. If a prime factor divides the given number multiple times, it should be repeated in the output as many times as it divides the given number.

You're already given an example solution that doesn't yet pass tests. Your task is to speed up this solution using parallelism.

Note, that you could also implement a more optimal serial solution, but it's not the goal of this task, so a more optimal serial solution won't be accepted even if it passes the tests.
